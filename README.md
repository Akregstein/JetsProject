#Jets Project


#Description
In The Jets Project I created a fleet of spacecraft that are held in an airfield. There were 3 different types of crafts and 6 individual models within those types. Each type of model had set a speed , range and price and two of the types of crafts had interface methods that allowed them to perform certain tasks such as move people

I created an interactive user menu in which a user can interact with the fleet. The options available to the user were:

List fleet
Fly all jets
View fastest jet
View jet with longest range
Load all Cargo Jets
Dogfight!
Add a jet to Fleet
Remove a jet from Fleet
Quit


#Technologies used
This project used try-catch to help minimize user input exceptions that I didn't know how to avoid on past projects.
I utilized a text file that stored the individual crafts stats and then incorporated that into my airfield class using an arraylist and a bufferedreader. Much of the rest of the technology built off my tools learned during the Foodtruck app.



### Lessons Learned
It was very interesting figuring out how to add and subtract a new Spacecraft by user input into the fleet so that it can be incorporated with all the other availble user interactions. I really learned the most from this aspect of the project.
